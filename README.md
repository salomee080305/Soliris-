# Soliris (Flutter)


Soliris is a Flutter app that displays real-time and historical wellness data from a wearable, and lets the user manage profile, privacy, display, Wi-Fi, and LED/Vibration settings.
The project focuses on accessibility (text scaling), clear theming (light/dark), and responsive UI.
